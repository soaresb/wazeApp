N is number of nodes. Since node:edge data preloaded into a python dictionary, (2) takes O(1). Shortest path uses Yens KSP algorithm; (3) takes approximately O(n^2)  To run the project: 1) Change nodedirectory, and edgedirectory in wazeApp.py, to the path on your local machine. 2) Change _directory_data in graph.py to /data/json on your local machine 3) Run wazeApp.py 4) Run the app in your browser at the appropriate address.
